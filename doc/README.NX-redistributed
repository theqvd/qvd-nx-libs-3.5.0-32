NX redistribution by X2Go
-------------------------
This source tree is a re-distribution of those NX packages needed to
setup FreeNX and/or X2Go on a Linux server.

The NX re-distribution currently is maintained by the X2Go Project:
http://wiki.x2go.org

Our goal is: 
    - provide _one_ tarball that builds NX projects via a common Makefile
    - provide _one_ tarball for distribution packagers

This re-distribution contains the following tarballs derived from
NoMachine (http://www.nomachine.com/sources.php):

  nxcomp
  nxcompext
  nxcompshad
  nxproxy
  nx-X11
  nxagent
  nxauth

The patches we apply are shipped with this tarball, for further introspection
please refer to this folder:

  doc/applied-patches

This source tree is maintained on the X2Go Git server:
Browsing...     http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary
Git-Cloning...  git clone git://code.x2go.org/nx-libs.git

If you have any questions about this NX redistribution or want to file 
a bug, then please contact the X2Go developers on
