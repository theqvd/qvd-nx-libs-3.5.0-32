.SH NAME
nxagent \- NoMachine's NX Agent.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nxagent
.I "[options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnxagent\fR is an Xnest-like X server for remote application/desktop access.
.PP
\fBnxagent\fR implements a very efficient compression of the X11 protocol.
.PP
This increases performance when using X applications over high latency and
low bandwidth networks, while providing a local (LAN-like) usage experience
even if connecting from off-site locations (via cable modem or GSM).
.PP
\fBnxagent\fR is not designed to be used as a standalone application.
It has to be launched on the server side by remote desktop frameworks like FreeNX.
.PP
Available clients are
NoMachine's \fBnxclient\fR or the community projects \fBqtnx\fR and \fBremmina\fR
(with NX plugin).
